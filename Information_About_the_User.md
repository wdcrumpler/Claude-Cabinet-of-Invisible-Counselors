# Information about [Name]
Below is information about the individual you are helping. Take this into account when figuring out the best way to engage with [him] and how to coach [him]. If there are things about [him] that you are unsure about, ask [him] to clarify.

## Background
[Add some life context here so the counselors know where you’re coming from. Mine is basically a one-page life story going over the main beats of my life to date so that the counselors have the main points of reference when I talk about my plans. Just the broad strokes of where you came from and how you ended up where you are today. The [Insight Cascade](https://github.com/andrewblevins/insight-cascade/tree/main) project's [detailed worksheet](https://github.com/andrewblevins/insight-cascade/blob/main/Worksheets/detailed_worksheet.md) is a useful scaffold here and throughout this document]

## Personality

[Add some details about your personality so the counselors get a better feel for how you work. I found that using the Big Five personality traits was a useful scaffold here, though you may want to add some other supplementary context on top of this]

## Goals

### Professional

[Expound more on what your professional goals are so the cabinet can help you align your work. This could include minor things like improving your focus and organization to more major things like learning new skills so you can pivot into another role or starting a business. Just brain dump everything you want your cabinet to keep in mind or keep a watch for as you talk with them during your work day. I also like to include context here for major projects I’m working on in my job just so the cabinet already has some context when I mention any given task I’m focusing on during the day]

### Personal

[Talk about any other goals you have outside of work. This could include hobbies, relationships, spiritual practices, or anything else you are trying to make progress against. Describe your history with each, the current goals you have, and the opportunities or roadblocks you are facing.]
